# Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, aiming to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. These patterns allow for greater flexibility in deciding which objects to create for a given use case.

## Projects

- **Builder Pattern**: Demonstrates the Builder Design Pattern through a House Builder use case.
- **Factory Method Pattern**: Illustrates the Factory Method Pattern with a Shape Factory example.

For specific usage instructions, refer to each projectâ€™s README file.
