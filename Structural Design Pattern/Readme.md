# Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns focus on how objects are composed to form larger structures. These patterns help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesnâ€™t need to do the same.

## Projects

- **Decorator Pattern**: Showcases the Decorator Design Pattern through a Coffee Shop use case.
- **Composite Pattern**: Demonstrates the Composite Design Pattern by allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

Refer to each project's README file for detailed instructions and usage.
