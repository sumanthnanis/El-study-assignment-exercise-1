# Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns focus on how objects are composed to form larger structures. These patterns help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesnâ€™t need to do the same.

## Projects

- **Decorator Pattern**: Showcases the Decorator Design Pattern through a Coffee Shop use case.
- **Adapter Pattern**: Implements the Adapter Design Pattern with an example that connects different interfaces.

Refer to each project's README file for detailed instructions and usage.
